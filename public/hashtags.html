<dt>going over</dt>
<dd>To "go over" a piece of graffiti simply means to paint on top of it.<sup id="cite_ref-SA_3-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SA-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> While most writers respect one another's artwork, to intentionally and disrespectfully paint on top of another's work is akin to a graffiti <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_war" title="Declaration of war">declaration of war</a>. However (due partially to the limited amount of desirable wall-space) most graffiti writers maintain a hierarchy of sorts; a tag can legitimately be covered by a throw-up, and a throw-up by a piece, and this is commonly done without incident. If a piece has previously been slashed (or "dissed"), it is also acceptable for another writer to go over it. To violate these guidelines, or to simply paint lower-quality graffiti on top of a higher-quality artist's work will quickly characterize a writer as an annoyance, or "toy." This is dangerous as most crews and writers will react with physical violence and/or by repeatedly going over writers not respecting their self-claimed rank in the hierarchy. <i>also: hot 110</i><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<dt>insides</dt>
<dd>Graffiti done inside trains, trams, or buses. In 1970s New York, there was as much graffiti inside the subway trains as outside, and the same is true of some cities today (like Rome, Italy and Melbourne, Australia). While still very common, <i>insides</i> are often perceived as being less artistic.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>king</dt>
<dd>The opposite of <b>toys</b>. <i>Kings</i> or <b>queens</b> (feminine) are writers especially respected among other writers. This is sometimes separated into "inside" and "outside" kings. To be a king of the inside means you have most tags inside trains (to "own the inside"), and to "own the outside" means having most pieces on the train surface. One should note that there are kings of <i>style</i> among a variety of other categories and the term is regionally subjective. For example, in Los Angeles a King would be someone who has achieved status by years in the graffiti longevity, style, ups, and originality. Self-declared kings will often incorporate crowns into their pieces; a commonly used element of style. However the people must be very self-confident when doing it, since other great writers tend to slash out self-proclaimed kings who have not gained that rank yet in their eyes. Typically a writer can only become a king if another king with that status already has expressed so.<sup id="cite_ref-SA_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SA-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<dt>Krylon</dt>
<dd>A paint brand that was one of the most popular with writers, it is thought of virtually synonymous with graffiti, due to general quality and availability. Heavily used during the hey-day of the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Subway" title="New York City Subway">New York City Subway</a> graffiti era during the early 1970s to late 1980s, it has a nostalgic status. Starting in mid-2008, the brand introduced a generation of paint can design with an irremovable cap system that sprays a rectangular coverage instead of the circular coverage preferred by writers. The paint quality is runnier and translucent in comparison to graffiti specialty brands. Sherwin Williams, Krylon's parent company, has dominated a significant portion of the paint market and many retail outlets stock only Krylon paints. For this reason, Krylon is categorized into three groups.

</div>
<dl>
<dt>tag (scribble)</dt>
<dd>A stylized signature, normally done in one color. The simplest and most prevalent type of graffiti, a tag is often done in a color that contrasts sharply with its background. <i>Tag</i> can also be used as a verb meaning "to sign". Writers often tag on or beside their pieces, following the practice of traditional artists who sign their artwork. A less common type of tag is a "dust tag", done by smudging the dirt of a wall with the fingers. Writers use this technique to get up without technically vandalizing. The verb tagging has even become a popular verb today in other types of occasions that are non-graffiti-related. Tagging first appeared in Philadelphia, with spraypainted messages of "Bobby Beck In '59" on freeways surrounding the city. Since then, individual graffiti scenes have displayed very different forms of tagging that are unique to specific regions. For example, a Los Angeles tag will look very different from a Philadelphia tag, etc. The first "king" was also crowned in Philly: <a href="/wiki/Cornbread_(graffiti)" title="Cornbread (graffiti)" class="mw-redirect">Cornbread (graffiti)</a>, a student who began marking his nickname around the city to attract the attentions of a girl. In New York City, <a href="/wiki/TAKI_183" title="TAKI 183">TAKI 183</a> inspired a newspaper article about his exploits, leading to an explosion of tagging in the early seventies.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>throw-up</dt>
<dd>A throw-up or <i>"throwie"</i> sits between a <i>tag</i> and a <i>bomb</i> in terms of complexity and time investment. It generally consists of a one color outline and one layer of fill-color. Easy-to-paint bubble shapes often form the letters. A throw-up is designed for quick execution, to avoid attracting attention to the writer. Throw-ups are often utilized by writers who wish to achieve a large number of tags while competing with rival artists. Most artists have both a tag and a throw-up that are essentially fixed compared to pieces. It is mostly so because they need to have a recognizable logo for others to identify them and their own individual styles.<sup id="cite_ref-SA_3-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SA-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<dd>Pieces on trains that cover the whole height of the car.<sup id="cite_ref-SA_3-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SA-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> A top-to-bottom, <i>end-to-end</i> combined production is called a <i>whole-car</i>. A production with several writers might cover a <i>whole-train</i>, which means the entire side of the train has been covered. In the U.S. this term can also be used as a single noun instead of only an adjective.</dd>

<dt><span id="toy"></span>toy</dt>
<dd>1. Used as an adjective to describe poor work, or as a noun meaning an inexperienced or unskilled writer.<sup id="cite_ref-SA_3-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SA-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Graffiti writers usually use this as a derogatory term for new writers in the scene, or writers who are old to the scene and still do not have any skill or reputation. The act of "toying" someone else's graffiti is to disrespect it by means of going over it (see "slash"/"going over").</dd>
<dd>2. "Toys" often added above or directly on a "toy" work. An acronym meaning, "<b>t</b>ag <b>o</b>ver <b>y</b>our <b>s</b>hit".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>undersides</dt>
<dd>Tags or signatures painted on the under carriage of passenger trains. Undersides are normally marked in the yard after painting the train panel, most undersides will last somewhat longer than the original piece, as the railway workers primarily focus on the most visible things and sometimes do not have resources to clean everything.</dd>

<dt>up</dt>
<dd>Writers become <i>up</i> when their work becomes widespread and well-known.<sup id="cite_ref-SA_3-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SA-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Although a writer can "get up" in a city by painting only tags (or throw-ups), a writer may earn more respect from skillfully executed pieces or a well-rounded repertoire of styles than from sheer number of tags. Usually the more spots a writer can hit, the more respect he or she gains. Usually, if the writer hits more spots with better style they will get more respect then someone who simply tags. A writers ups is determined by how much prolific graffiti he/she has accomplished. Writers are considered "up" both in terms of the number of spots they have hit, but also those that are still running.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>whole car</dt>
<dd>A single or collaborative piece that covers the entire visible surface of a train car, usually excluding the front and rear of the train. A whole car is usually worked upon by either a single artist or several artists from the same crew and is completed in one sitting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>whole train</dt>
<dd>All train cars (usually between four and eight or more, regardless of the train length) completely covered with paint reaching the far end of the train on one or both sides. Such demanding actions are often done by multiple artists or crews and with a limited variation of colors - commonly in black and silver - because of the stressing time limitation they are facing when painting in the train yards (very often less than 30 minutes). However the more artists who participate, the better works can come out of it and the cars are done quicker too. This type of graffiti, if finished successful, is one of the most respected forms amongst other writers, but is also rarer due to the higher risk of getting caught. it has also been known that 'crews' of graffiti artists would demonstrate their 'whole cart/train' skills, usually carried out by waiting at a train/metro stop or station, waiting for the train to approach. then when stopped quickly cover the full area of the cart, this can be finished within 2 minutes of the train pulling into the station.</dd>

<dt>window-down (...)</dt>
<dd>Used mostly as a prefix for a <i>whole car</i> (other variations are possible too) where the content has been painted below the window borders, almost always covering the whole surface in its length (see <i>end to end</i>). Can be used as a more precise alternative to the mentioned term within the brackets, but though not in addition to <i>top-to-bottom</i> as that will exceed the definition of the term.<sup id="cite_ref-SA_3-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SA-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
